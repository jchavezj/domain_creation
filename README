domain_creation
===============

This is a simple script that creates a domain on RHEL/CentOS running Apache

===========================================================================

To install:
git clone https://github.com/jchavezj/domain_creation.git
cd domain_creation
bash setup.sh

To use the script just run as root:

vhcreator.sh <domain.com>

===========================================================================


The setup.sh script checks if the directory /etc/httpd/vhost.d and if it does not find it will create the directory.
Then it will copy the template to "/etc/httpd/vhost.d" and copy the vhcreator.sh to /usr/bin/. 
finally it appends the directive "include vhost.d/*conf" to the httpd.conf file.
